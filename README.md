# A simple jupyter widget, presented as a notebook extension: interactive d3 circle drawing

After learning some of the basics of jupyter widget programming, as described
[here](https://github.com/paul-shannon/jupyter-widget-demo-all-in-notebook) -
this example combines all the python and javascript code for the widget
in a single small notebook - I next turned to, and present here, the same
simple d3 widget as a jupyter notebook extension.  In that form it can be
downloaded, installed, and used in any notebook, with all the implementing
code hidden from view.
